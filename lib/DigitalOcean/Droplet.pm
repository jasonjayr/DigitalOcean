If you would like a different C<per_page> value to be used for this collection instead of L<per_page|DigitalOcean/"per_page">, it can be passed in as a parameter:

    #set default for all collections to be 30
    $do->per_page(30);

    #set this collection to have 2 objects returned per page
    my $kernels_collection = $droplet->kernels(2);

This will retrieve the backups that have been created from a Droplet
by returning a L<DigitalOcean::Collection> that can be used to iterate through the L<DigitalOcean::Backup> objects of the backups collection. 
 
    my $backups_collection = $droplet->backups;
    my $obj;

    while($obj = $backups_collection->next) { 
        print $obj->name . "\n";
    }

If you would like a different C<per_page> value to be used for this collection instead of L<per_page|DigitalOcean/"per_page">, it can be passed in as a parameter:

    #set default for all collections to be 30
    $do->per_page(30);

    #set this collection to have 2 objects returned per page
    my $backups_collection = $droplet->backups(2);
    my $obj;

    my ($self, $per_page) = @_;
    return $self->DigitalOcean->_get_collection($self->path . 'backups', 'DigitalOcean::Backup', 'backups', {per_page => $per_page});
}

=method actions
 
This will retrieve all actions that have been executed on a Droplet
by returning a L<DigitalOcean::Collection> that can be used to iterate through the L<DigitalOcean::Action> objects of the actions collection. 
 
    my $actions_collection = $droplet->actions;
    my $obj;

    while($obj = $actions_collection->next) { 
        print $obj->id . "\n";
    }

If you would like a different C<per_page> value to be used for this collection instead of L<per_page|DigitalOcean/"per_page">, it can be passed in as a parameter:

    #set default for all collections to be 30
    $do->per_page(30);

    #set this collection to have 2 objects returned per page

    my $obj;

    while($obj = $actions_collection->next) { 
        print $obj->id . "\n";
    }
 
=cut

sub actions { 
    my ($self, $per_page) = @_;
    my $init_arr = [['DigitalOcean', $self]];
    return $self->DigitalOcean->_get_collection($self->path . 'actions', 'DigitalOcean::Action', 'actions', {per_page => $per_page}, $init_arr);
}

=method delete

This deletes the droplet. This will return 1 on success and undef on failure.

    $droplet->delete;
    #droplet now gone

=cut

sub delete { 
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->DigitalOcean->_delete(path => $self->path);
}

=method neighbors

This method returns all of the droplets that are running on the same physical server as the L<DigitalOcean::Droplet> object this method is called with.
It returns an array reference.

    my $neighbors = $droplet->neighbors;

    for my $neighbor (@$neighbors) { 
        print $neighbor->name . "\n";
    }

=cut

sub neighbors { 
    my ($self) = @_;

    return $self->DigitalOcean->_get_array($self->path . 'neighbors', 'DigitalOcean::Droplet', 'droplets');

}

=method action

This will retrieve an action associated with the L<DigitalOcean::Droplet> object by id and return a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->action(56789);

=cut

sub action { 
    my ($self, $id) = @_;

    return $self->DigitalOcean->_get_object($self->path . "actions/$id", 'DigitalOcean::Action', 'action');
}

=head2 Actions

=method disable_backups

This method disables backups on your droplet. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->disable_backups;

=cut

sub disable_backups { shift->_action(@_, type => 'disable_backups') }

=method reboot

This method allows you to reboot a droplet. This is the preferred method to use if a server is not responding. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->reboot;

A reboot action is an attempt to reboot the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the reboot command from the console.

=cut

sub reboot { shift->_action(@_, type => 'reboot') }

=method power_cycle

This method allows you to power cycle a droplet. This will turn off the droplet and then turn it back on. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->power_cycle;

A powercycle action is similar to pushing the reset button on a physical machine, it's similar to booting from scratch.

=cut

sub power_cycle { shift->_action(@_, type => 'power_cycle') }

=method shutdown

This method allows you to shutdown a running droplet. The droplet will remain in your account. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->shutdown;

A shutdown action is an attempt to shutdown the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the shutdown command from the console. Since a shutdown command can fail, this action guarantees that the command is issued, not that it succeeds. The preferred way to turn off a Droplet is to attempt a shutdown, with a reasonable timeout, followed by a power off action to ensure the Droplet is off.

=cut

sub shutdown { shift->_action(@_, type => 'shutdown') }

=method power_off

This method allows you to poweroff a running droplet. The droplet will remain in your account. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->power_off;

A power_off event is a hard shutdown and should only be used if the shutdown action is not successful. It is similar to cutting the power on a server and could lead to complications.

=cut

sub power_off { shift->_action(@_, type => 'power_off') }

=method power_on

This method allows you to poweron a powered off droplet. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->power_on;

=cut

sub power_on { shift->_action(@_, type => 'power_on') }

=method restore
 
This method allows you to restore a droplet with a previous image or snapshot. This will be a mirror copy of the image or snapshot to your droplet. Be sure you have backed up any necessary information prior to restore.
It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.
 
=over 4
 
=item
 
B<image> Required, string if an image slug. number if an image ID., An image slug or ID. This represents the image that the Droplet will use as a base.
 
=back
 
    my $action = $droplet->restore(image => 56789);

A Droplet restoration will rebuild an image using a backup image. The image ID that is passed in must be a backup of the current Droplet instance. The operation will leave any embedded SSH keys intact.

=cut

sub restore { shift->_action(@_, type => 'restore') }

=method password_reset

This method will reset the root password for a droplet. Please be aware that this will reboot the droplet to allow resetting the password. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->password_reset;

=cut

sub password_reset { shift->_action(@_, type => 'password_reset') }

=method resize

This method allows you to resize a specific droplet to a different size. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

=over 4
 
=item
 
B<disk> Optional, Boolean (1 or undef), Whether to increase disk size

=item
 
B<size> Required, String, The size slug that you want to resize to.
 
=back

    my $action = $droplet->resize(
        disk => 1,
        size => '1gb', 
    );

In order to resize your droplet, it must first be powered off, and you must wait for the droplet
to be powered off before you can call resize on the droplet. Making the call accurately would look something like this:
 
    $droplet->power_off(wait_on_action => 1);

    my $action = $droplet->resize(
        disk => 1,
        size => '1gb', 
        wait_on_action => 1,
    );

    $droplet->power_on(wait_on_action => 1);
             
If your droplet is already on and you want to resize it and boot your droplet
back up, you can call L</resize_reboot> to do the above code for you.

=cut

sub resize { shift->_action(@_, type => 'resize') }

=method resize_reboot
 
In order to call L</resize_reboot>, your droplet must be powered off.
If your droplet is already running, this method makes a call to L<resize|/"resize">
for you and powers off your droplet, and then powers it on after it is done resizing
and handles L<waiting on each event|DigitalOcean/"WAITING ON EVENTS"> to finish so you do not have to write this code.
This is essentially the code that L</resize_reboot> performs for you:
 
    $droplet->power_off(wait_on_action => 1);

    $droplet->resize(
        disk => $disk,
        size => $size,
        wait_on_action => 1,
    );

    $droplet->power_on(wait_on_event => 1);

So a call to L</resize_reboot> would look like:

    my $actions = $droplet->resize_reboot(
        disk => 1,
        size => '1gb', 
    );

    for my $action (@$actions) { 
        print $action->id . ' ' . $action->status . "\n";
    }

It returns an array reference of all three actions returned by L</power_off>, L</resize>, and L</power_on>.
 
=cut
 
sub resize_reboot { 
    my $self = shift;
    my @arr;

    push(@arr, $self->power_off(wait_on_action => 1));
    push(@arr, $self->resize(@_, wait_on_action => 1));
    push(@arr, $self->power_on(wait_on_action => 1));

    return \@arr;
}

=method rebuild

This method allows you to rebuild a Droplet. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.
A rebuild action functions just like a new create. This is useful if you want to start again but retain the same IP address for your droplet.

=over 4
 
=item
 
B<image> Required, string if an image slug. number if an image ID., An image slug or ID. This represents the image that the Droplet will use as a base.
 
=back

    my $action = $droplet->rebuild(
        image => 'ubuntu-14-04-x64',
    );

=cut

sub rebuild { shift->_action(@_, type => 'rebuild') }

=method rename
 
This method renames the droplet to the specified name. The new name is reflected in the L<DigitalOcean::Droplet> object.
It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.
 
=over 4
 
=item
 
B<name> Required, String, The new name for the Droplet.
 
=back
 
    $droplet->rename(name => $new_name);
 
=cut

sub rename { 
    my $self = shift;
    my (%params) = @_;

    my $action = $self->_action(@_, type => 'rename');
    $self->name($params{name});
    return $action;
}

=method change_kernel

This method allows you to change the kernel of a Droplet. It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

=over 4
 
=item
 
B<kernel> Required, Number, A unique number used to identify and reference a specific kernel.
 
=back

    my $action = $droplet->change_kernel(kernel => 991);

=cut

sub change_kernel { shift->_action(@_, type => 'change_kernel') }

=method change_kernel_reboot
 
In order for a new kernel to be active, the machine must be powered off and then powered on. This function changes the kernel
for you and powers off your droplet, and then powers it on. It also handles
L<waiting on each event|DigitalOcean/"WAITING ON EVENTS"> so you do not have to write this code.
This is essentially the code that L</change_kernel_reboot> performs for you:

    $droplet->change_kernel(kernel => $kernel);
    $droplet->power_off(wait_on_action => 1);
    $droplet->power_on(wait_on_event => 1);

So a call to L</change_kernel_reboot> would look like:

    my $actions = $droplet->change_kernel_reboot(kernel => 991);

    for my $action (@$actions) { 
        print $action->id . ' ' . $action->status . "\n";
    }

It returns an array reference of all three actions returned by L</change_kernel>, L</power_off>, and L</power_on>.
 
=cut

sub change_kernel_reboot { 
    my $self = shift;
    my @arr;

    push(@arr, $self->change_kernel(@_, wait_on_action => 1));
    push(@arr, $self->power_off(wait_on_action => 1));
    push(@arr, $self->power_on(wait_on_action => 1));

    return \@arr;
}

=method enable_ipv6

This method allows you to enable IPv6 networking on an existing Droplet (within a region that has IPv6 available). It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->enable_ipv6;

=cut

sub enable_ipv6 { shift->_action(@_, type => 'enable_ipv6') }

=method enable_private_networking

This method allows you to enable private networking on an existing Droplet (within a region that has private networking available). It returns a L<DigitalOcean::Action> object.

    my $action = $droplet->enable_private_networking;

In order to enable private networking for your droplet, it must first be powered off, and you must wait for the droplet
to be powered off before you can call snapshot on the droplet. Making the call accurately would look something like this:
 
    $droplet->power_off(wait_on_event => 1);
    $droplet->enable_private_networking(wait_on_event => 1);
    $droplet->power_on(wait_on_event => 1);
 
If your droplet is already on and you want to enable private networking and boot your droplet
back up, you can call L</enable_private_networking_reboot> to do the above code for you.

=cut

sub enable_private_networking { shift->_action(@_, type => 'enable_private_networking') }

=method enable_private_networking_reboot
 
In order to call L</enable_private_networking>, your droplet must be powered off.
If your droplet is already running, this method makes a call to L</enable_private_networking>
for you and powers off your droplet, and then powers it on after it is done 
and handles L<waiting on each event|DigitalOcean/"WAITING ON EVENTS"> to finish so you do not have to write this code.
This is essentially the code that L</enable_private_networking> performs for you:

    $droplet->enable_private_networking(wait_on_action => 1);

    $droplet->power_on(wait_on_event => 1);

So a call to L</enable_private_networking_reboot> would look like:

    my $actions = $droplet->enable_private_networking_reboot;

    for my $action (@$actions) { 
        print $action->id . ' ' . $action->status . "\n";
    }

It returns an array reference of all three actions returned by L</power_off>, L</enable_private_networking>, and L</power_on>.

=method snapshot
 
This method allows you to take a snapshot of the droplet once it has been powered off, which can later be restored or used to create a new droplet from the same image.
 
=over 4
 
=item
 
B<name> Optional, String, this is the name of the new snapshot you want to create. If not set, the snapshot name will default to date/time
 
=back
 
In order to take a snapshot of your droplet, it must first be powered off, and you must wait for the droplet
to be powered off before you can call snapshot on the droplet. Making the call accurately would look something like this:
 
    $droplet->power_off(wait_on_event => 1);
    $droplet->snapshot;
 
If your droplet is already on and you essentially want to take a snapshot and boot your droplet
back up, you can call L/snapshot_reboot> to do the above code for you. (The L</snapshot> method turns the droplet back on for you).

=head2 snapshot_reboot
 
If your droplet is already running, this method makes a call to L</snapshot>
for you and powers off your droplet, and then powers it on after it is done taking a snapshot
and handles L<waiting on each event|DigitalOcean/"WAITING ON EVENTS"> to finish so you do not have to write this code.
This is essentially the code that L</snapshot_reboot> performs for you:
 
    $droplet->power_off(wait_on_event => 1);
    $droplet->snapshot(wait_on_event => 1); #snapshot powers your droplet back on for you
 

So a call to L</snapshot_reboot> would look like:

    my $actions = $droplet->snapshot_reboot;

    for my $action (@$actions) {
